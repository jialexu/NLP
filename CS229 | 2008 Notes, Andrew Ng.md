# Stanford CS229 | 2008 Andrew Ng | Notes

handwritten notes, medical records used by learning algorithms to generate useful results and researches.

learning algorithms: email zip code, check written signature, credit card fraud check, etc.

growing understanding of human genes.

### three teaching goals for this class
  convey his own excitement about machine learning
  
  apply state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm to intereted problems
  
  be qualified to start doing research in machine learning
  
#### prerequisite
Big O, tree, queue... programming experience.
probabilities, statistics,
linear algebra,

study group encouraged

project: pick a topic/problem and use learning algorithm; 
previous projects online;

"who knows Matlab/Octave?"

# Machine Learning definition

Arthur Samuel 1959: field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. 

Tom Mitchell 1998: Well-posed learning problem: A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

## Supervised Learning

regression problems: collect data set of house pricing, 

give the algorithm the right answers, and want the alg. to learn and give us more of the right answers. 

classification problems.
